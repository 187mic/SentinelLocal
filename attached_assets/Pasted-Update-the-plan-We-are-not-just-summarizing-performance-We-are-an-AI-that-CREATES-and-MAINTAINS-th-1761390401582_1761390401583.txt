Update the plan. We are not just summarizing performance. We are an AI that CREATES and MAINTAINS the client’s Google Business Profile (GBP / GMB) and Google Ads campaigns, and keeps optimizing them.

You must extend the data model, backend routes, seed script, and UI to include the following. Treat this as part of MVP, not future work.

1. NEW PRISMA MODELS
Add these models to schema.prisma:

model BusinessProfileSetup {
id String @id @default(cuid())
user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
userId String

status String // "not_started" | "in_progress" | "live"
businessDesc String? // proposed Google Business Profile description text
categories String? // comma-separated proposed categories
servicesOffered String? // comma-separated service keywords
serviceArea String? // comma-separated zips / cities
hoursJSON Json? // proposed hours structure
lastUpdated DateTime @default(now())
}

model AdsCampaignPlan {
id String @id @default(cuid())
user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
userId String

campaignName String
geoTargets String? // comma-separated zips / cities
keywordsJSON Json // [{keyword, matchType, bid}]
negativeKeywords String? // comma-separated negatives
dailyBudget Decimal @db.Decimal(10,2)
bidStrategyNote String? // plain-English explanation for the owner
status String // "draft" | "active" | "paused"
lastOptimizedAt DateTime @default(now())
}

model OptimizationAction {
id String @id @default(cuid())
user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
userId String

timestamp DateTime @default(now())
area String // "GBP" | "ADS"
actionSummary String // "Raised bid on '24hr AC repair bellevue' to $2.60"
impactNote String? // "Expected +15% call volume after 6pm"
}

Now update the User model to include these relations:

model User {
id String @id @default(cuid())
businessName String
email String @unique
hashedPassword String
phone String?
serviceAreaZipCodes String? // comma-separated list for now
planTier String // "starter" | "growth" | "dominance"

adSummaries AdSummary[]
chatMessages ChatMessage[]


businessProfileSetup BusinessProfileSetup?
adsCampaignPlans AdsCampaignPlan[]
optimizationActions OptimizationAction[]
}

2. SEED SCRIPT UPDATE
In /scripts/seed.js you must now:
- Create a BusinessProfileSetup row for the demo user:
status="live"
businessDesc="We are a 24/7 emergency HVAC and furnace repair company serving Tacoma and Bellevue."
categories="HVAC contractor, Emergency AC repair"
servicesOffered="24hr furnace repair, emergency AC repair, seasonal tune-up"
serviceArea="Tacoma, Bellevue, Seattle"
hoursJSON with Mon-Sun hours
- Create one AdsCampaignPlan for that user:
campaignName="24/7 Emergency HVAC Leads"
geoTargets="Tacoma,Bellevue"
keywordsJSON with high-intent service keywords and sample bids
negativeKeywords="free, salary, DIY"
dailyBudget=50.00
bidStrategyNote="Focus bids on emergency / after-hours calls where close rate is highest."
status="active"
- Create two OptimizationAction rows for that user:
1) area="ADS", actionSummary="Paused keyword 'cheap furnace fix' after $47 spend and 0 calls", impactNote="Cut waste, redirect budget to '24hr AC repair bellevue'."
2) area="GBP", actionSummary="Posted Fall Tune-Up 20% Off promo to Google Business Profile", impactNote="Drives seasonal maintenance bookings."

3. NEW MARKETING ROUTES
Create /backend/routes/marketing.js with two routes:

GET /api/marketing/overview (JWT-protected)
- Return:
- the user's BusinessProfileSetup
- the most recent active AdsCampaignPlan
- the 5 most recent OptimizationAction rows (ordered by timestamp desc)
This powers the 'Active Campaigns' section of the dashboard.

POST /api/marketing/optimize (JWT-protected)
Body: { "area": "GBP" | "ADS" }
Behavior:
- If area="GBP":
Call lowCostGenerate(prompt) from llmClient asking for a new Google Business Profile promo post (limited-time seasonal offer, friendly tone).
Create a new OptimizationAction row with area="GBP" and actionSummary summarizing the suggestion.
Return the suggestion text.
- If area="ADS":
Call criticalGenerate(prompt) from llmClient asking for what bid change or negative keyword to apply next based on spend/leads.
Create a new OptimizationAction row with area="ADS" and actionSummary summarizing the suggestion.
Return the suggestion text.

For now, DO NOT actually call external APIs. The llmClient functions can return stub strings like:
- "Proposed GBP Post: 'Fall Furnace Tune-Up — 20% Off This Week Only. Call Now, We’re Local.'"
- "Ads Optimization: Pause 'cheap furnace fix', raise bid on '24hr AC repair bellevue' by $0.50 after 6pm."

4. DASHBOARD UI UPDATE
Update /frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx:
In addition to the three existing cards:
- "This Week's Results"
- "Reputation Health"
- "Open Fires"
You MUST also render an "Active Campaigns" section that calls GET /api/marketing/overview.

Display:
- GBP status: not_started / in_progress / live
- Ads status: draft / active / paused (from AdsCampaignPlan.status)
- Last 2-3 OptimizationAction.actionSummary lines, newest first (e.g. "Paused keyword 'cheap furnace fix'...")

Also add two small buttons:
- "Optimize Google Profile"
- "Optimize Ads Budget"
When clicked, POST /api/marketing/optimize with {area:"GBP"} or {area:"ADS"} and show the returned suggestion text right below the button.

5. POSITIONING REQUIREMENT
In README.md, clearly state in the project description:
"Sentinel Local is NOT just analytics. It is an AI marketing operator. It creates and maintains a client's Google Business Profile and Google Ads campaign, continuously tunes keywords, bids, and promos, and logs every optimization action so the business owner sees what was done for them."

Repeat all of the above back to me in your own words, then update your generation plan and file scaffolding so that these new models, routes (/api/marketing), seed data, and the 'Active Campaigns' dashboard section are included in the initial code output.
